The future is regenerative. It has to be.
> "Doing good is good for business" - Richard Branson

Addressing climate change is more than just tracking carbon dioxide. The effects of a changing climate are here and it's more than warming. It's more intermittent and more intense rain, extended droughts, ocean acidification, 100-year storms yearly and the list goes on.
 
We need to not only remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere but also increase the resilience of our civilization to the extreme weather we now see on a regular basis.
 
**Enter regenerative agriculture with ruminant animals.**
 <!--more-->
If you put ruminant animals on grassland and use rotational grazing to mimic predator induced movement, their magic fermenting stomachs will turn that grass into microbial life that will revitalize the soil and put carbon in the ground. For every 1% increase in soil organic matter (about half is carbon) an acre of land can absorb 20,000 more gallons of water. That's about .74 inches of rain. Using regenerative practices, a target is an increase of 1% per year. Instead of all that water running off and causing floods it could be absorbed by the ground and banked for later to be more drought resistant.
 
**Some main regenerative agriculture practices**
- No till (tilling the land releases carbon and kills the beneficial soil microbes when exposed to air)
- Cover crops (keeping the ground covered reduces water loss and keeps the topsoil alive)
- Rotational grazing
 
**Benefits**
- Lower input costs (fertilizer, herbicides, fungicides, water, labor/equipment for tilling)
- Better weather resilience
- Higher selling price of crops and meat due to higher quality and nutrient content
- Sequesters carbon (carbon credits can be an additional source of income)
 
**Where does web3 come in?**
 
web3 is creating the infrastructure layer to solve coordination failures. And climate change is the biggest coordination failure of all. Current markets fail to price in the cost of emitting carbon and the benefit of sequestering it, not to mention the other myriad negative effects of current industrial agriculture. The web3-native regenerative finance movement is working to redefine the flows and forms of capital so the right things are valued and the right things are explicitly captured as costs. This is where the Richard Branson quote comes in. With incentives aligned with what our civilization needs to survive, doing things for profit will be doing good for us all. 
 
A lot of the current web3 focus is on the Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM). It makes sense as a starting point. It's an existing market. Increase transparency and eliminate the double spend problem by using blockchains. Makes sense, those are literally the main advantages of blockchains. Create a more efficient market to give carbon credit produces more of the purchase price, i.e. cut out the middlemen. Makes sense, increase the incentive for climate positive action.
 
And we need more. And more is coming. web3 is still in the early stages but experimentation and iteration are fast. More on this to come.
